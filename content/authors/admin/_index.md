Hi! I am Denzil Ekow Bilson, a gradauate researcher with BLAST Labs at the University of Colorado, Boulder. My research work focuses on constructing a flexible framework for characterizing collaborations in conversations via high-level discourse cues bytaking advantage of LLMs for few-shot/zero-shot learning.
I have extensive industry experience, including 3 software engineering internships with Google and 2 internships with Lyft (not to mention a whole bunch of failed startups üòù)
